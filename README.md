# national_forest_finder

App Concept - a National Forest Finder.  The user can put in their current location 
(using the google maps geolocation api, which will automatically find it), and it will return
National Forest near you.  Also uses data from data.gov, to search for what's around you.
Also, the ability for users to add in their favorite campsites.
